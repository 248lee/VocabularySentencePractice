along_with discipline in_terms_of scheme on_account_of 
Tom, along with his friends, have been planning to skip the school on account of the tough discipline. In terms of morality, the scheme wasn't good, but we should acknowledge that they're brave to break the school rules.
湯姆和他的朋友們一直因為嚴厲的紀律而打算逃學。從道德上講，這個計劃不好，但是我們應該承認他們很勇敢違反學校的規定。
