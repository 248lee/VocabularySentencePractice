appliance burden swift academic divorce 

Tom, the most popular basketball player, was the best player in the academic team when he was in college. His swift action and the surprising accuracy of 
shooting made him become the tomorrow star. However, he started to drug last year. This caused the divorce with his wife, huge judicial burden, and the rapid 
reduction of his income. Now the poor Tom can only live in a little house with few appliances.

湯姆（Tom）是最受歡迎的籃球運動員，在上大學時是學術團隊中最好的球員。他的敏捷動作和驚人的投籃準確性使他成為明日之星。但是，他去年開始吸毒。這導致與妻子離婚，
巨大的司法負擔以及收入的迅速減少。現在可憐的湯姆只能住在很少有電器的小房子裡。
