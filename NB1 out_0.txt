Although he was insecure about winning the race, he still strive to guard the aggression from Tom. At last, he came back to win the champion of GGO, and make the competition become the most distinguish GGO event ever.

去年GGO冠軍湯姆（Tom）對他應該在比賽中獲得的每一分都感到神經過敏。他的對手蒂姆不是一個好玩家。儘管他對贏得比賽沒有安全感(沒有自信贏得比賽)，但他仍在努力防範湯姆的侵略。最後，他回來贏得了GGO冠軍，並使比賽成為有史以來最有特色的GGO賽事。
